# LocationWeatherApp

Android Architecture Component libraries are the engine of this application. It's running, MVVM using Room, ViewModel, Live Data and Life Cycles. A recycler view is used to show the list, I prepulate the Room databse with locations which then can be deleted(left/right swipe), edited and added to the list and database.

I plan on making the app more scale-able, robust and low coupled by implementing of Dagger 2, Auto Value Moshi, RxJava. Will also add networking for showing weather for each location on the list. Testing with JUnit, Mockito and Espresso is also in the pipeline.
